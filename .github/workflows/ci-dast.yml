# ======================================================
# Dynamic Application Security Testing Workflow - Stage 3
# ======================================================
# This workflow performs dynamic security testing (DAST) 
# on the running Tradeport frontend application using 
# OWASP ZAP security scanner.
#
# Key Features:
# - Builds the application in production mode
# - Starts a local server to host the application
# - Runs OWASP ZAP scanner against the running instance
# - Generates an HTML security report
#
# The workflow runs on pull requests to main and can
# be manually triggered.
